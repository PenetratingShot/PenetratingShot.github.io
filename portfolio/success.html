            <li style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><span class="code">“Only those who dare to fail can ever achieve greatly.” -Robert F. Kennedy </span></li>

        <h6>What is Success?</h6>
        <p class="code" style="margin-right:12%;">How I define success is not neccessarily whether I was able to complete a task, or win in a game. It's what I learned while completing the task how how useful it will be later on in my life. For example, I learned to code by doing a bunch of examples that I ound online. I didn't attend any kind of formal schooling, and yet I know how to code. Those were small achievements that I got, when my code would compile. But greater than that was the fact that I was slowly learning how better ways to solv ea problem, and become immune to certain types of bugs that I've encountered on the way. I have forgotten the examples that I looked at and what I did, but the knowledge I gained from completing them has stayed with me.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>What is Failure?</h6>
        <p class="code" style="margin-right:12%;">To me, failure is when I haven't reached the things that I want to be in life. What I want to be isn't by any means predefined as of right now, and is subject to change, however it's an overarching concept of what I want to do. If I end up doing something that I just do not enjoy and dread as my day job, I'll consider that path as a failure. This doesn't mean that I'll stop trying to pursue what I like, it just means that I'll try to think ahead when making decisions. I would try to think how these decisions will impact where I end up later on in life. I will try to make decisions based on the most favorable outcome -- i.e. what I would like to do in the future.</p>
