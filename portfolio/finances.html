        <h5>Reflection</h6>
        <p class="code" style="margin-left: 0.5%; margin-right: 12%; text-indent: 40px;">While doing the budget, I was surprised that I could even afford an apartment, car, and health insurance making 60k a year. I knew that rent for apartments and the cost/maintenence of cars is absurdly high in Dublin. While I didn't include a car in the budget, with the money that I put into savings per year, I would've been able to get a pretty decent used car (probably hybrid or electric) for that mone yI put into savings. While I couldn't go all out on buying things, I was able to get a decent living out of the 60k budget. For example, I found a nice apartment next to the BART station, a train that I would be using every day to get to work. In addition, I also found renters insurance and health insurance for a relatively sheap price, since I don't have major health complications which require me to be on life support my entire life. I was also able to get some personal electronics on the side, just because I had around 17k left to spend. I don't think that I would be very happy, but at 26 right out of college, it definetly would be a good starting point for me to build off. I would probably be happier if I made a little more, so that I could put more money into savings in order to get better items. It would be enough for me to be happy day to day, however I don't think I would spend the rest of my days in an apartment with a roommate. I would probably save up to buy a house and live on my own or something like that. I think that most entry level jobs, such as a store manager for a small chain would start at around 60-70k. </p>
