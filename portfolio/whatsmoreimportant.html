    <h4 style="padding-left:15px; color: #ff5e5e";>What's More Important?</h4>
    <p style="font-size:16px; padding-left:15px; color:white;">This is what I've learned about myself though the course of this semester.</p>
    <br>
    <div style="color: white; padding-left: 12px;">
        <h5>Reflection</h5>
        <p class="code" style="margin-left: 0.5%; margin-right: 12%; text-indent: 40px;">I have learned alot about myself through this activity. It showed how I rank things  based on how they relate to my life and how important I percieve them to be at a given moment in time. For example, I would first prefer to be financially stable before finding love, as it becomes hard to support two people instead of one. I also prefer to learn about the skills I need to be able to do for a job before attempting it instead of having a "Just do it" attitude without knowing how to actually complete the job.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Responses</h5>
        <div class="col s12 m6" style="padding-right:12px">
        <div class="card" style="background-color: #424247;">
          <div class="card-content white-text">
            <span class="card-title" style="color:#ff5e5e;">Love or Money?</span>
            <p class="code" style="text-indent: 40px;">It depends on what your current situation is. If you’re currently very financially strained, then obviously you would prioritize survival over being with someone or something. If you’re feeling comfortable with your future, you would want someone to spend that with. I would prefer love over money simply because I feel that having tons of money isn’t everything in life. Obviously you need to it to survive, however throwing yourself into isolation is equally, if not more detrimental to your health. Really, it just depends on your financial situation and whether you’d be more comfortable not earning as much as you can.</p>

        <div class="card" style="background-color: #424247;">
          <div class="card-content white-text">
            <span class="card-title" style="color:#ff5e5e;">Fame or Wealth?</span>
            <p class="code" style="text-indent: 40px;">I think that wealth is more important than fame. I don’t want to be that one person that everyone is talking about and copying, and I don’t necessarily care about making connections with other people. I think that personally, wealth is more important than fame because I like to sit by myself and just work on something. I tend to not work on group project often, unless of course, I’m forced to for a grade. I’m perfectly happy just working on something by myself and getting everything from that. Now we can move this point of view onto this question. I don’t care if I make an impact on someone’s lives or help them in some way. It’s great if I do, but I’ not necessarily striving to help other people wherever I can. I just like to keep to myself and I’m content with it. </p>

          <div class="card-content white-text">
            <span class="card-title" style="color:#ff5e5e;">Intelligence or Determination?</span>
            <p class="code" style="text-indent: 40px;">I think that intelligence is more important than determination. If you have an ability, then you’re already at a higher starting point than everyone else, which you can use to your benefit. From then on, everything in that category will be easy for you and you might enjoy doing it. Furthermore, you can’t do anything just because you’re determined to do it. In some cases, you have to have that ability in the first place; you have to start at a higher point than everyone else so that you can move forward. In addition, the fact that you have an ability doesn’t determine how you want to pursue that subject. A person who is determined to draw and a person who is already good at drawing both want to continue drawing, it’s just that one of them is better than the other. Having an ability, or an advantage, over everyone else doesn’t necessarily mean that the person with that ability is going to slack off and not care at all. If that person is genuinely interested in the field that they’re good at, then they’ll succeed just as well as a person that has determination (this is case-specific).</p>

          <div class="card-content white-text">
            <span class="card-title" style="color:#ff5e5e;">Knowledge or Grades?</span>
            <p class="code" style="text-indent: 40px;">I feel like the answer to this is that both knowledge and grades are important. You need to have grades in order to get into college, which is essentially the gateway to knowledge (College, the Gateway to Knowledge… we should put that on a sign). In addition, knowledge in certain fields is absolutely required when you go out into the real world, you need to learn how to do things by yourself. In school, you can know how to do a particular thing, and still fail your tests. For example, I could know how to do Algebra, but if I fail Algebra, I’ll still know the concepts but I’ll be left behind. People won’t care if you know something, they care if you are able to demonstrate your knowledge in different situations. So if you fail your tests, it means that you don’t know how to apply your knowledge, making it essentially worthless since you have no idea what to do with it. Your knowledge doesn’t mean anything if you’re grades aren’t good, which is generally a good indicator of what you know in a topic.</p>
